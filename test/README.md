# Regression Testing

Place holder for what I want to do:

    1. Create the database / install in a testing directory/db.

    2. CGI requests (using Perl CGI module) to:
        * create competition
        * create task 
        * submit known track logs
        * score
        * validate results against known results

    Variations on this for:
        * task types
        * different GAP configurations
        * valid/invalid tracks
        * airspace checking
        * leadout
        * etc

    3. Report PASS/FAIL for each test
