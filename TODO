TEST:

Fix up installation so a normal person can do it ...
    - /usr/local/lib/site-perl for perl modules

Check awarded waypoints work

Tracklog animation with multiple tracks 
    + color each track separately
    + have a timer / stepper (ala CompeGPS)
    + add pilot initials on picture

Automatic airspace violation checks
    + import airspace files ..
    + airspace management - add/delete
    + link airspace(s) to a competition
    + check track against linked airspace

Track submission:
    + note if track is not IGC format
    + add KML support

Check new task type (worked for NTVO - 400m cylinders only):
    + accumulation of waypoints (airgain)

Calculate short 'routes' for fixed-route "comps".
    + fixed route comps more like race-comps now - even GAP scored

Modifying waypoints in regions isn't working.
    - should add a 'cancel' to reset a moved icon

BUGS:

Automatic airspace violation checks
    - check radiuses

Make an "install" package for Cpanel
    (basically create the database without a command line)

Improve error messages for rejected track uploads

Create a database update script for schema changes to be applied to older version

Fix bug (with entry cylinder around take-off on jump .. weird):
    wasinSS= taskss=4500 startss=2402 starttime=2402 interval=900
    speedrun-interval .. startss=2402 taskss=4500
    Jumped the start gate (0) (taskss=4500 finish=36000) (startss=2402: 2402)
    Elasped entry jump: jumped 2098 secs
    wcount=-1 wmade=0
    Didn't make the start
    ** Use of uninitialized value $z in cos at /usr/share/perl/5.10/Math/Complex.pm line 909.
    ** Use of uninitialized value $z in sin at /usr/share/perl/5.10/Math/Complex.pm line 926.
    No distance achieved

Possible problem with leadout coeff for late start on race task (see Wes Manzke track corryong 2011)

Possible bug with lead-out coefficient for start-gate jumpers (esp in elapsed-interval?)

Implement independent start gates for teams properly


TODO:

Add a time bonus for height above goal arrival

Conical ESS sections

Peleton scoring

Alternative lead-out point system

Handle broken tracklogs better (allow more admin intervention)
    - allow "time-shift"ing tracks for bad almanacs (?)
    - allow merging of two tracks (from same pilot)

Competition entry access restrictions (restricted + table or open)
    - automatic 'abs' addition

Launch open / close times (and checking of them)

Finish fsdb export so its closer to compliant with fsdb
    - link it to an admin page so admin users can download a copy for CIVL submission

New task types
    - open area enclosed (AAT)
    + team/group time trial (separate air start gates, see above)
    - fastest around fixed-distance course with large radius turnpoints

Handle 'free-bearing scoring'
    Check distance calculation back to course line (free-bearing especially)
    specified via a waypoint(extend to 1000km away?) 
    - need an initial task waypoint + bearing specified

For 'olc' and 'free' tasks
    ~ Handle included waypoints
    (use track_verify_sr.pl, if all waypoints met then OLC/free score)

Add a 'copy task' facility in task creation (from tasks on same day and previous day)

Add other types of scoring with customisable bonuses:
    FAI triangle, 
    flat triangle,
    Out & return 

Automatic airspace violation checks
    + import airspace files ..
    + check track against nearby airspace
    + airspace management - add/delete
    + link airspace(s) to a competition
    - check radiuses
    - large airspace db handling

Interpolate crossing times for intersection with start line & goal cylinder

More info on tracklog maps as an overlay:
    best free-distance distance ?
    launch time, landing time
    best climb / biggest sink
    average speed on course/track
    max height (?), min height ..
    click to see details on a point
    time thermalling vs gliding
    left / right turning in thermals

NICE TO HAVE:

A software specification

A guide for comp administrators

Thermal maps from tracklogs

A "barograph" style trace with tracklogs

Support GPSDump/KML waypoint format

Clean up glider names with canonical ones

Hack around the IE bug for button submits not sending the value (low)

Improve CSS so that it "stretches" for wider screens,
    provide more detail for scoring

Verify track 'G' record
    - need windows vali-XXX.exe or .dlls :-(
    (vali-xdg, vali-bra, vali-xct, etc)
    - apparently most do RSA/MD5 digest with a key (based on serial #?)
    - perhaps reverse engineer GPSDumps dodgy G record ..
    - and perhaps run windozes exes through wine / dosemu

DONE:

* Adding task waypoints should automatically assign the "next" value if none provided.

* Bulk IGC import 

* Show 'team' results somewhere if they're available

* Track submission should report success immediately,
    even with very slow google maps.

* Interval start gates 
    + need to have a specified number of gates somewhere ..

* Check awarded waypoints work

* Interval start gates 
    
* Create a user page for selecting a competition

* Regional grouping of tracks for global viewing

* Ozi explorer format waypoint download

* Tracklog download

* Color tracklog for height

* Handling 'route' competitions with multiple tasks

* Deal with tracklogs submitted before task creation

* Competition time offset

* Competition scoring types (ftv, all, round)

* Show waypoint diameter circles

* Add BO / DNF option for track submission

* Task/GAP scoring.

* Login security - limit access to specific competitions (ie. ones you create)

* Add 'score' button to competition page

* Link waypoint regions to tasks

* Management page for users/fai nos

* View the tasks 

* View the overall results 

* Create an open source web project for this (googlecode graxce)

* Deal with changes to task creation
    re-verify all tracks
    warn on bad task creation (no goal) (add automatically)?

* Makefile / install

* Lead out points/coefficients

* Scoring with arrival/depart turned off (rescale to day quality)

* Check GAP 2002/2007  scoring without leadout coeffs (= GAP 2000)

* Scoring.
    + Test scoring API
    + NZL scoring

* Test more downloads with multiple tracks over multiple dates
    (possibly resequence as time offset from first point)

* Interval gate disappears on task admin page

* Shortest route calculation (rather than to centre of waypoints)
    + in a cartesian fashion at least ...

+ Pre-submitted tracklogs being picked up by the wrong tasks

+ Printable b/w CSS  (needs fixing for aggregate results)

+ Team handling / scoring
    + team creation
    + aggregate team flying results
    + team flying gap scored 

* Track submission should report success immediately,
    even with very slow google maps.

* Bulk pilot import

* Show 'team' results somewhere if they're available

* Tracklog animation with multiple tracks 
    + color each track separately
    - have a timer / stepper (ala CompeGPS)

* Team handling / scoring
    - or just aggregate individual results (for normal comp)
